            "Now, translating the YAML steps. The first action is utter_transfer_money_understand, which probably starts the process. Then collecting account_from and payee_name. The action_check_payee_existence checks if the payee exists. If not, it calls add_payee. Then get_transfer_amount, which checks if the amount is valid. Then checking sufficient funds. Depending on timing, it either confirms immediate transfer or schedules a future one.\n",

            "\n",
            "For example, action_check_payee_existence would require that payee_name is collected. If payee doesn't exist, add_payee is called. So in PDDL, the precondition would be that payee_name is known, and the effect would set payee_exists.\n",

            "Transitions between steps are handled by the order of actions and their effects. Each action's effect would enable the next action's preconditions.\n",
