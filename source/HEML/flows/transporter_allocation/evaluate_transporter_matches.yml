      Given a list of equipment part IDs and available transporters, evaluate all m Ã— n combinations
      to find the optimal transporter that can carry the maximum number of compatible equipment parts
      without breaching transporter capacity constraints. If multiple transporters qualify equally,
      a sampling strategy will be applied to choose one.
